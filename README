./ceph-deploy-setup.sh to install ceph-deploy in the current node.

./ceph-node-setup.sh <user@node>... to do preflight tasks on each node.

./ceph-cluster-bootstrap.sh <user@node>... to bootstrap ceph.
The first node is used as the master node.

If necessary, install ceph client with ./ceph-install.sh

After bootstrapping is complete, add OSDs to the cluster:
ceph-deploy osd create --data {device} {ceph-node}

Proceed to create pools for storage applications. 
Note that Kubernetes doesn't need a CephFS setup; a pool is sufficient.
